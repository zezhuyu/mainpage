In the beginning, I registered the domains zezhuyu.com and zezhuyu.me so that I could connect to my home server. Over the next four years, the project spawned more and more sub-projects. As of March 2022, the project has sub-projects including but not limited to SAM CLOUD, SAM CDN & APPX, and SCLRNET. SAM CLOUD is a personal cloud learning project that focuses on cloud storage, cloud computing, and hardware virtualization.
